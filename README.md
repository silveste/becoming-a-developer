## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am building it, and **organise all my notes and exercices** about languages, frameworks etc.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to find out how git and github works.

In order to organise all topics, there is a list of subjects, which are the learning targets, and a list of learning materials that are the resources to achieve the targets.

All the information about subjects is contained in markdown files in the "subjects" directory. The reason because there are a lot of ".md" files is because I used them to learn markdown.

The topics to learn are based in my personal preferences.

## List of Subjects <!--Future: If a new subject is added remember update MD template-->

The following topics has been chosen to have a general overview about the frontend and backend. The topics are sorted by areas and listed in alphabetical order.

The repository is organised in branches related with subjects. Therefore by switching to a branch different than master, only the information (exercices, notes) will be shown.
