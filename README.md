## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am doing it and **organise all my notes and exercices** to become a developer and also a third one smaller goal which is learn markdown.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to find out how git and github works.

In order to organise all topics that I would like to learn. I set a list of subjects which are my learning targets and a list of learning materials that are the means to achieve them.

Regarding the subjects, all the information is contained in markdown files in subjects directory. The reason why there are a lot of markdown files is because I used them to learn it.

The chosen topics to learn are based in my personal preferences. From my personal point of view I decided to learn a bit about everything (Frontend and Backend) to have a general overview and then decide which one I would like to specialize.

This repository only covers the general overview part. Regarding the time needed to achieve all goals I consider that it would take around 3 years (1.5 already done at the time that I started the repository) or 1 dedicating full time.
