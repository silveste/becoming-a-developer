## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: learn about GIT and GitHub while I am building it, and organise the notes and exercices about languages, frameworks etc.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to find out how git and github works. The master branch contains all notes and exercises, to check notes or exercises only about a specific subject simply shift to its branch.
