## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am doing it and **organise all my notes and exercices** to become a developer. For those that don't know where to start I recommend visit [kamranahmedse developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

## List of Subjects
