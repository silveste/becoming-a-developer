## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am doing it and **organise all my notes and exercices** to become a developer and also a third one smaller goal which is learn markdown.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to find out how git and github works.

In order to organise all topics that I would like to learn. I set a list of subjects which are my learning targets and a list of learning materials that are the means to achieve them.

Regarding the subjects, all the information is contained in markdown files in subjects directory. The reason why there are a lot of markdown files is because I used them to learn it.

## [Java (core)](subjects/java(core).md)

You are currently in branch **learning-java-core**, if you want to see all subjects switch to master

## Learning materials: courses, books <!--Future: If a new material is included use the MD template to include it-->
