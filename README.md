## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am doing it and **organise all my notes and exercices** to become a developer and also a third one smaller goal which is learn markdown.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to find out how git and github works.

In order to organise all topics that I would like to learn. I set a list of subjects which are my learning targets and a list of learning materials that are the means to achieve them.

Regarding the subjects, all the information is contained in markdown files in subjects directory. The reason why there are a lot of markdown files is because I used them to learn it.

## List of Subjects <!--Future: If a new subject is added remember update MD template-->

The following topics are my goals to become a frontend, backend or even full stack developer. The topics are sorted by areas and listed in alphabetical order.

Every link leads to a markdown in the subjects directory that contains a comprehensive description (usually from wikipedia), the materials used to learn about it, documentation used as a reference guides and related topics.

The repository is organised in branches related with subjects, so that the information is more concise regarding a particular subject when switching to its branch. This is because a specific subject can be covered by more than one course and a specific course can include more than one subject, therefore, it is possible to see only the exercises of a particular subject by changing the branch for that subject. For example, the branch learning-javascript contains only exercises related with javascript.

The courses/books where the exercises come from are indicated in every commit message
